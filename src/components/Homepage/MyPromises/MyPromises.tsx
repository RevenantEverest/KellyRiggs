            Effective leaders are rare. According to research, roughly 1-in-7 managers are 
            considered by their employees to be effective leaders. However, there is a special 
            subset of managers with a specific combination of skills who are considered to be 
            great leaders 74% of the time! Unfortunately, less than 1% of managers have the 
            critical skills sets that make for great leadership! To be a great leader, you 
            simply need to learn a specific set of skills that are rarely taught. 
            I will teach you those skills.

            The Top 7% of salespeople are different than the other 93%. They do things differently, 
            of course, but, more importantly, they think differently. To reach the summit of 
            the selling profession requires a critical shift in mindset: how you approach your 
            profession, how you approach customers, and how you approach each and every day. It also 
            requires a specific set of skills that enable the Top 7% of salespeople to overcome, 
            adapt, and consistently win where others don't. I will teach you those skills.
